# Gazi University Student Platform

### In practice, I created the student platform of Gazi University, of which I am a student. When creating the project: 
<br/>
-I designed my interface according to the Responsive structure <br/>
-I designed the transitions between the pages using navigation <br/>
-I paid attention to the file hierarchy <br/>
- While changing the page with navigation, I got the information entered on the previous page. <br/>
